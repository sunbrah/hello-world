# hello-world

I'm a 33 year old roofer based out of the bay area.  I keep hearing a lot about coding boot camps and how web development is an in-demand trade. I've decided to peruse some resources online (namely the The Odin Project) to see if I can't teach myself some coding and figure out if this is a realistic career route for me.
